# autodots

A tool to make the task of creating install scripts for dots easier

## System requirements

- Made for arch
- The script assumes that you used [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall) to setup your system. It only requires
the minimal profile to be selected, otherwise some dependencies might not be installed
